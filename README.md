# Angular-Application
 Implementing student survey application using a simplified version of the survey form and serverless computing technologies. This application architecture uses Angular2, AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, Amazon S3, and Amazon DynamoDB. The angular application is deployed in S3 bucket using S3â€™s static Web site hosting capability. It sends and receives data to/from the backend using Lambda and API Gateway. DynamoDB provides a persistence layer where data can be stored by the API's Lambda function. The application allows prospective students to fill out a survey form to provide feedback about their campus visit. It also allows users to view all surveys recorded to date. The application starts with a welcome homepage, which in essence has two links: 1) Student Survey, which allows a prospective student to fill out a survey form, and 2) List All Surveys, which allows a user to view all surveys done to date.
